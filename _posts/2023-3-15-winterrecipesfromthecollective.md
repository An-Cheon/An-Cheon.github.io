#### I try to comfort you

I say a prayer for the wind to lift us                  
but it does no good;                       
                       
I try to comfort you                 
but words are not the answer;              

I sing to you as mother sang to me—                
Your eyes are closed.              

And then we are simply falling—                
And the world goes by,                  
all the worlds, each more beautiful than the last;                    
I touch your cheek to protect you—                      

you will realize I am not                          
a young man anymore, my hair is silver.                

my body a burden to me.         

We search for it all of our lives,             
even after we find it.            

Joyful—now there’s a word              
we haven’t used in a while.        

I felt I had no future at all.        
I had tried and I had failed.             
I had mistaken my failures for triumphs.             

In the night I can see my own soul.         

they look calm, but calm is not the truth.                   
Despair is the truth.                  

All hope is lost.                 
We must return to where it was lost          
if we want to find it again.             

Where did you go next, after those days,            
where although you could not speak you were not lost?
