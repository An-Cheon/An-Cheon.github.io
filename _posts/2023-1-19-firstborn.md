#### Birth, not death, is the hard loss. I know. I also left a skin there.
<!-- more -->
And they sat—as though paralysis preceding death                                        
Had nailed them there. 

Everything went in the car.                  
Slept in the car, slept            
Like angels in the duned graveyards,              
Being gone.

After Edgartown                  
We went the other way.

You let him                  
Rob me. But                    
How long? how long?        
Past cutlery I saw                   
My body stretching like a tear                   
Along the paper.              

Always nights I feel the ocean           
Biting at my life.

I watched her tucking skin              
As though she missed her young, while bits of onion             
Misted snow over the pronged death.          

You live in me. Malignant.            
Love, you ever want me, don’t.              

As endlessly she picks           
Her spent kleenex into dust, always           
Staring at that man, hearing the click,                 
Click of his brain’s whirling empty spindle …           

You hover loyally above my head. I close                
My eyes. 

I feel             
No end. No end. It stalls            
In me. It’s still alive.            

Last year. Above the dead valves pines pared              
Down by a storm stood, limbs bared …                  
I want you.         

I saw               
Venus among those clamshells, raw           
Botticelli: I have known no happiness so based in truth.             

We heard they live on love.             
What now? You miss my care? Your yard ripens               
To a ward of roses, like a year ago when staff nuns               
Wheeled me down the aisle …                  

You couldn’t look. I saw               
Converted love, your son,              
Drooling under glass, starving …             

We are eating well.           
Today my meatman turns his trained knife             
On veal, your favorite. I pay with my life.             

Her pride          
And joy she said. I have no pride.           

Birth, not death, is the hard loss.            
I know. I also left a skin there.            

That Death wooed us, by water, wooed us              
By land: among the pines             
An uncurled cottonmouth that rolled on moss            
Reared in the polluted air.                    

Birth, not death, is the hard loss.               
I know. I also left a skin there.          

Flies, snails. Asleep I saw these                
Beings as complacent angels of the land and air.               

My first house shall be built on these sands,            
My second in the sea.                

In Westchester, the crocus spreads like cancer.                
This will be the death of me. I feel the leaves close in,          
Promise threaten from all sides and above.             

Dawn off Georgia stole her whole         
Hold’s gold and slew that living cargo.             

Words fail me.            

I know what’s slipping through my fingers.
