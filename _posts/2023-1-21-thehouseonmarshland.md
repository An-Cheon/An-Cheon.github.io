#### They rise up blacker than childhood.
#### Had you died when we were together I would have wanted nothing of you.       
<!-- more -->
Come here           
Come here, little one       
And the soul creeps out of the tree.
           
Night covers the pond with its wing.

They rise up              
blacker than childhood.

This is the world we wanted.            
All who would have seen us dead               
are dead. 

I hear the witch’s cry              
break in the moonlight through a sheet            
of sugar: God rewards.            

you above them, wounded and dominant.         

I am no longer young. What                
of it? Summer approaches, and the long                  
decaying days of autumn when I shall begin              
the great poems of my middle period.               

I have cast off—the sunlight             
chipping at the curtains               
& the wicker chairs             
uncovered, winter after winter,              
as the stars finally              
thicken & descend as snow               

There is a soul in me          
It is asking              
to be given its body          

I heard my name            
not spoken but cried out              

And you never say               
Leave me                 
since the dead do not like being alone.                

Had you died when we were together           
I would have wanted nothing of you.            

It is night for the last time.              
For the last time your hands          
gather on my body.               

Tomorrow it will be autumn.            
We will sit together on the balcony           
watching the dry leaves drift over the village              
like the letters we will burn,               
one by one, in our separate houses.
